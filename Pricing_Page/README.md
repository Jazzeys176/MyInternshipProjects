# Pricing Page (Week 1 Project):
In this project, I have used various HTML, CSS and JavaScript files for its working.
<br>
About the Project:
<ul>
  <li>This is the Pricing Page for the Music Streaming Service: GROOVEVERSE containing three plans which are "INDIVIDUAL", "STUDENT" and "FAMILY".</li>
  <li>Drop Down menu was used which can convert the currency of the fee for each of the plans according to the country selected. </li>
  <li>While there is a "I WANT IT" button present, it just changes its colour when the mouse pointer hovers over it.</li>
  <li>The font used was Poppins and light colours were used, giving the entire webpage a pleasant look. </li>
</ul>
<br>
<br>
Here is the video of the working of the Pricing Page: <br>
