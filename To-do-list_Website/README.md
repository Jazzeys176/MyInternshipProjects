# Do-it List: The To-do list Website (Week 4 project)
About: <br>
This To-Do list website can: <br>
<ul>
  <li>Add a task.</li>
  <li>Edit the task that you have added.</li>
  <li>Delete the task.</li>
  <li>Strike it off when clicked on the 'Completed' Button</li>
  <li>Saves your task so that when you revisit the wwebpage, it will show you your previously added tasks.</li>
</ul>
<br>
I have used:
<ul>
  <li>HTML for the basic structure. </li>
  <li>CSS for styling the "Add task". "Edit", "Delete" and the "Completed" button.</li>
  <li>JavaScript for Adding, Editting, Deleting and Striking off the task Dynamically. I also used it to store the Tasks in LocalStorage <br> so that it would show it when one revists the website. </li>
</ul><br>

Here is the video of the working of the "Do-it list" website: <br>
