# Registration Form (Week 2 Project):
About this project:
<ul>
  <li>This is a basic webpage for Registration form.</li>
  <li>This registration form contains different fields which are:
    <ul>
      <li>First Name</li>
      <li>Last Name</li>
      <li>Email</li>
      <li>Password</li>
      <li>Confirm Password</li>
      <li>Gender</li>
      <li>Select your country</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>JavaScript is used to ensure that the Register Button works and you get a proper "Registration Successful" Message only after all the fields are filled. </li>
  <li>If any field is not filled properly, a small pop-up appears beside that particular field, telling the user to fill that field.</li>
  <li>Finally, I added small touches to the form like when you agree to terms and conditions then it shows an animation of the box getting ticked. </li>
</ul>
